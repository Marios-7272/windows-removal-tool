# Windows removal tool
Welcome to Windows removal tool site! This is a concept of a program which:
- deletes Windows,
- installs Linux,
- keeps all the user data intact,
- installs all the previously present programs.
It is targeted to people who either want to start their Linux adventure with some training wheels or need their grandma's computer to run linux, because it is from 6 years ago and you don't want to discard it yet. 

#### Disclaimer:
I am a Polish highschool student who can't code at all but daily drives Linux. This is my first project ever. I will make a ton of misakes, so do not expect everything to be correct, let alone neat and easily understandable. 

#### Inner workings:
I imagine it to make these steps:
1. ask for admin privileages
2. make a list of all installed programes
3. "translate" them to something linux understands (more about that later)
4.
